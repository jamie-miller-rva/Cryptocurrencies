# Crypto Currencies Analysis using Clustering


# Background:
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. 

# Problem Statement:
Identify what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

# Deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
